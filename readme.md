The goal of this test is to utilize the existing code and transform it in a functional UI where a user can page between a set of products. You can use any tools and frameworks (this goes for both JS and CSS) you need to complete the test. 

If you want to do it in vanilla JavaScript using nothing but DOM manipulation, ES6 and regular CSS, that is perfectly fine. 

This page is currently missing any form of styling and the content is unfiltered. To complete this test, this page will need to be updated to ensure the user can do the following things:

1. Able to see a set (does this mean "static" or "user set"?) number of products (between 10 to 20) in a grid system.
   
2. Able to click on a product and have its information displayed in a modal window

The information required to be displayed are (this must mean the modal as as the example finished doesn't have it in the grid-items view):

Product Name 
Product Image 
Product Description
Product Price 
Supplier Name


Able to paginate between the products and see the result set of products.
